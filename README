Ffalarms
========

Ffalarms is a program to set multiple alarms a day using a finger
friendly user interface (hence the name).

Three clicks to set an alarm time.  Progressive volume.  Snoozed with
double click and turned of with a slider.  LED night clock included.

Ffalarms uses an analog-like clock face to select a time of the alarm
so only one to three clicks are needed to pick a time: one to select
an hour, optional one to select a minute (if not 0), and optional one
to select AM/PM (if not AM).

The alarm starts quietly and slowly increases the volume up to the
maximum.  Thus you may be awaken by a gentle sound if your sleep is
shallow (especially if you select a nice tune as an alarm), but you
may require it to get louder if you are in a deep sleep or hard
working and ignoring distractions from environment.

Ffalarms also contains a 7 segment LED-like night clock.

The source code is hosted in a git repository at

http://git.shr-project.org/git/?p=ffalarms.git;a=summary


Inspirations
------------

The 7 segment LED-like night clock is inspired by the `LED clock`_
(`on opkg.org`__), which I have discovered on opkg.org_ while having
ffalarms usable on my Neo FreeRuner (though not yet in a releasable
state).

Dependencies
------------

Ffalarms is written in Vala_ (0.7.7 is known to work).

Requires:

- `EFL Vala Bindings`_ (libeflvala) >= r65653
- `libical`_
- atd_ (may be atd-over-fso_ working on top of FSO_ platform)
- ``alsa-utils-amixer`` ``ttf-dejavu-sans``

Optional:

- FSO_ platform (to avoid suspend during alarm by FSO_ platform and
  change backlight brightness in LED clock mode)

Suggested media players
-----------------------

``mplayer`` or ``alsa-utils-aplay`` (voc, wav, raw or au only)


Features
--------

- Best works on distributions featuring Elementary_ and FSO_ (such as
  SHR_).  Earlier versions (up to 0.2.2, written in Python) work on
  `Om 2008.12`_ and SHR_.

- Supports recurring alarms.

- Supports snoozing.

- May be configured to use any media player, such as MPlayer_, but
  works out of the box with aplay_ from ``alsa-utils-aplay``.

- LED night clock `12/24 hour mode, brightness and color`_ are
  configurable.

- Adding, listing, and removing alarms is possible from command line
  (see `Command line options`_ below).

- LED clock and analog clock alarm selection are completely themeable,
  as they are implemented in Edje_ using Embryo_ for logic.

- It currently depends on atd_ for alarm scheduling and FSO_ for other
  device interactions such as requesting CPU and Display and setting
  brightness of the LED clock.

Limitations
-----------

- Ffalarms knows nothing about:

  - Silent profiles: it will play the alarm any way (but on a surplus
    side you can set Silent profile for the night if you wish and it
    will not prevent the alarm to wake you up).

- Ffalarms is currently only configurable through a configuration file
  (see Configuration_ below)

- Currently the list of alarms is not refreshed if the alarms have
  been altered by another instance of ffalarms or the alarm finished.


Configuration
-------------

On `Om 2008.12`_ install ``alsa-utils-aplay`` together with
``ffalarms`` and it should work out of the box.  But if you want to
use other alarm file or player than read on.

The configuration is done through a file ``~/.ffalarmsrc``. If
configuration file does not exist or contains errors (ffalarms will
display proper message) then the default configuration is used which
is equivalent to ::

    [alarm]
    player=aplay -q %(file)s
    file=/usr/share/ffalarms/alarm.wav
    repeat=500
    snooze=5, 60
    volume=60, 100, 105
    alarm_script=/usr/share/ffalarms/alarm.sh

    [ledclock]
    24hr_format=true
    brightness=33

Which will play a given file 500 times (ie. for about 5 minutes).  But
if you have MPlayer_ installed you can use its ``-loop`` option to
obtain the same effect (and then omit repeat as it obviously defaults
to 1) ::

    [alarm]
    player=mplayer -really-quiet -loop 500 %(file)s
    file=~/song.mp3

Reference ``%(file)s`` in the player option will be expanded to a
value of file option with leading tilde (``~``) replaced with the home
directory and proper shell quoting if needed.

The alarm may be snoozed by double clicking the acknowledge window (by
default five times for 60 seconds).

By default volume of the alarm starts at 60 and increases up to 100,
the increase takes 105 seconds.  You can change it by setting
``volume`` to a similar list of three numbers or a fixed volume
(single number).  You can use special value of -1 for ffalarms not to
change the volume.

For example you could use vibrator to play the alarm

  | [alarm]
  | repeat=10
  | player=sh -c 'mdbus -s org.freesmartphone.odeviced /org/freesmartphone/Device/LED/neo1973_vibrator org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.BlinkSeconds 2 100 100; sleep 10'
  | volume=-1

.. _12/24 hour mode, brightness and color:

LED clock by default uses 24 hour format, you can change it to 12 hour
format by setting ``24hr_format`` to ``false``.  You can change the
color by setting ``color`` to ``red, blue, green`` (numbers in range
0-255).  You can also change brightness of the LED clock (which is 33
by default, 100 is the maximum), use special value of -1 to not change
the brightness, for example ::

    [ledclock]
    24hr_format=false
    color = 255, 255, 0
    brightness=-1

TODO
----

- Should preserve list selection on list update.

- The list would get more readable if the items would be of the form
  "Today 18:30", "Tomorrow 7:00" in huge letters.  Would require
  responding to change of date at midnight.

- May support "repeat=5m" for playing the alarm for five minutes
  instead of given number of times.

- may add "killing the alarm by accelerators would be an excellent
  option!"  (suggested by Vanous)
